# Predictive-Maintenance-System-for-EV-Motors

# I. Core Concept:
This project aims to develop a sophisticated Predictive Maintenance (PdM) system for Electric Vehicle (EV) motors. The central idea is to continuously monitor key operational parameters of an EV motor in real-time to detect subtle anomalies and predict potential failures before they occur. By enabling proactive maintenance interventions, this system seeks to significantly reduce unexpected downtime, prevent catastrophic failures, extend the motor's lifespan, and ultimately lower operational costs and enhance vehicle reliability and safety.

# II. Problem Statement & Motivation:
EV motors are critical, high-value components. Unexpected failures can lead to significant inconvenience, high repair costs, and safety concerns. Traditional reactive or time-based maintenance approaches are often inefficient, leading to either unnecessary maintenance or unforeseen breakdowns. A predictive maintenance system, by identifying early warning signs of degradation, offers a more intelligent and cost-effective approach to asset management.

# III. Objectives:
    1. Real-time Data Acquisition
    2. Efficient Data Pre-processing
    3. On-Device Anomaly Detection
    4. Proactive Alerting
    5. Optional Data Logging

# IV. Expected Outcomes:
    1. A functional prototype of an embedded predictive maintenance system on an STM32 platform.
    2. Demonstrated ability to acquire, process, and analyze sensor data in real-time.
    3. Proof of concept for anomaly detection using thresholding and trend analysis.
    4. An effective alerting system for early fault detection.
    5. A foundation for future expansion into more advanced prognostics and communication capabilities.
